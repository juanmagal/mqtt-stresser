# MQTT Stresser

Load testing tool to stress MQTT message broker

## Build

```
$ mkdir -p ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/inovex/
$ git clone https://github.com/inovex/mqtt-stresser.git ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/inovex/mqtt-stresser/
$ cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/inovex/mqtt-stresser/
$ make linux
```

This will build the mqtt stresser for all target platforms and write them to the ``build/`` directory.

Binaries are provided on Github, see https://github.com/inovex/mqtt-stresser.

If you want to build the Docker container version of this, go to repository directory and simply type ``docker build .``

## Install

Place the binary somewhere in a ``PATH`` directory and make it executable (``chmod +x mqtt-stresser``).

If you are using the container version, just type ``docker run flaviostutz/mqtt-stresser [options]`` for running mqtt-stresser.

## Configure

See ``mqtt-stresser -h`` for a list of available arguments.

## Run

Simple hello-world test using the public ``broker.mqttdashboard.com`` broker: (please don't DDoS them :))

```
$ mqtt-stresser -broker tcp://broker.mqttdashboard.com:1883 -num-clients 100 -num-messages 150 -rampup-delay 1s -rampup-size 10 -global-timeout 180s -timeout 20s
